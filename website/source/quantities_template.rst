Computators in WfBase can be used to store a lot of data.  Information about this data can be accessed using the :func:`info <wfbase._ComputatorWf.info>` function.  Below is an example code that computes various data, stores it into a computator *comp*, and then accesses information about all of this data.

Here you can find :ref:`more information <structure_computator>` about the structure of the computator object.
