WfBase is a software package providing an easy way to compute from first-principles various properties depending on the electronic structure of periodic solids.  This package can parse user-provided mathematical expressions, in a human-readable format, using the Einstein notation for indices.  This package also comes with a built-in database of some simple materials.  For more details, please see:
